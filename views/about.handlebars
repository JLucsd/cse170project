       <h3><b> About GIST </b></h3>
       <h5 style="text-align:justify">The existing popular apps for grocery shopping has its main focus on saving money and saving time.
These apps mainly provide organized ways to store lists and also save money by easily accessible
coupons and ways to compare prices. Our GIST app incorporates this timesaving
idea by providing
the resource of helping the user save time with their stored lists, but what makes our app different is
that there is an automated rearrangement according to the specified market so that the user can
efficiently shop without going back and forth in the market. We approach the issue of time differently
from other apps with the perspective from the psychological phenomenon “planning fallacy”, which
states that people have a great tendency to underestimate the time needed to complete a certain
task. With GIST, we combat this fallacy by helping users see their own habits by tracking their
grocery shopping behavior. Whenever the user goes shopping, the user can log the total amount of
time, their mood and hunger level. The items they bought can also be recorded. This data along with
the visualization is a powerful tool for users to be able to recognize first that there are wasteful habits
they can change and to use GIST as a means to help them change their behavior</h5>
